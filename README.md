blogSite is a blogging platform that lets users create, edit, and delete blog posts as well as read eachothers posts. Posts can be read by anyone, but creating posts requires an account.  Users can only edit or delete their own posts. The blogs menu item brings up all existing blog posts. Upon logging in, the new menu item is for creating posts, and the old menu item is for accessing posts created by the user. Built with node, express, mongodb, and semantic ui.
